**Building a Large Language Model (LLM) from Scratch**


This project is focused on building, pretraining, and fine-tuning a Large Language Model (LLM) from scratch using modern machine learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The goal is to create a functional, transformer-based LLM that can be fine-tuned for instruction-based tasks, drawing inspiration from popular architectures like GPT-2. This project explores each stage of the model-building process, from defining the architecture and loading pretrained weights, to preparing custom datasets and instruction fine-tuning for specific tasks. 

This project leverages PyTorch and TensorFlow for model construction, training, and fine-tuning, while incorporating several performance optimizations such as efficient weight loading and LoRA-based fine-tuning.

This project is inspired by and incorporates supplementary code from Sebastian Raschka's book "Building a Large Language Model from Scratch."

**Key Features**

1) **Tokenizer:** The Tokenizer Jupyter notebook covers key steps in text preprocessing and tokenization. It reads raw text, splits it into tokens using regular expressions, and creates a vocabulary that maps tokens to unique IDs. The notebook also introduces a custom tokenizer, SimpleTokenizerV1, which converts text into token sequences and back into readable text. It also demonstrates tokenization with the tiktoken library using GPT-2 encoding, handling special tokens. This provides a strong foundation for preparing text data for model training and experimentation.

2) **Architecture:** The Architecture Jupyter notebook focuses on building and training a simplified GPT architecture. It begins by defining a configuration for a small GPT model, specifying key parameters like vocabulary size, embedding dimensions, attention heads, and layers. The main model, GPTModel, uses transformer blocks and embedding layers to process input tokens and generate predictions. The notebook includes examples of tokenizing text using tiktoken, running input through the model, and generating output sequences. Additionally, a simple text generation function is provided to extend text based on input tokens by sampling from the modelâ€™s output.

3) **Pre-Training:** The Pre-Training Jupyter notebook focuses on pretraining a simplified GPT model. It defines a model configuration with key parameters like vocabulary size and context length. Using tiktoken for GPT-2 encoding, the notebook demonstrates text generation based on input tokens. It includes a training loop that splits data into training and validation sets, tracks losses, and evaluates model performance. After each epoch, a sample text is generated, and the model is saved with visualized training results. This setup provides a straightforward approach to pretraining and evaluating a GPT model.

4) **Weight Loading:** The Weight Loading Jupyter notebook demonstrates loading pretrained GPT-2 model weights, configuring different model sizes (small, medium, large, XL), and assigning weights to a custom torch GPT model. After loading the weights, it performs text generation using tiktoken for encoding and showcases text generation with the litgpt library. The setup effectively illustrates weight loading and inference with a GPT model.

5) **Fine Tuning:** The Fine Tuning Jupyter notebook on fine-tuning demonstrates the process of working with instruction-based data to fine-tune a language model. It reads a dataset from a JSON file, processes it to create model inputs and outputs, and splits the data into training and test sets. The notebook uses a fine-tuning command with the litgpt library to fine-tune the model on this dataset. It also includes functionality for scoring model responses based on a predefined scoring mechanism. This setup provides a complete workflow for fine-tuning a model using instruction-based tasks.

**Conclusion**

This project successfully demonstrates the process of building a Large Language Model (LLM) from scratch using transformer-based architectures like GPT. By combining modern machine learning techniques with efficient tokenization, architecture design, weight loading, and fine-tuning processes, the project provides a comprehensive guide to constructing and optimizing LLMs. The use of tools like PyTorch, tiktoken, and litgpt ensures that each stage, from pretraining to fine-tuning for specific tasks, is done efficiently and effectively. Through this project, we've shown how instruction-based tasks can be leveraged to fine-tune models for specific applications, paving the way for future improvements and extensions in the realm of NLP.
